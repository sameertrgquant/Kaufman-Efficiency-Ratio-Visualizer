# Kaufman-Efficiency-Ratio-Visualizer

Kaufman- efficiency ratio is developed by the Perry kaufman, this ratio helps the traders recognizing the noisy markets and the trending ones thus they can trade with the more precision 

Formula
eff_ratio=net change in the price over the lookback period(positive)/change on every day(positive)

The ER oscillates between 0 and 1. Trending markets typically exhibit ERs closer to 1, while choppy or noisy markets have ERs closer to 0.

lookback period is the period on which we want to calcualte the ratio, Using a longer lookback period will ‘squeeze’ the ER values together, possibly making it less useful in filtering signals.

if the efficiency ratio is greater than the 0.65 than it must be a potential trending market in either direction
